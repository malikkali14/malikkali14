<h1>**Hello World!**</h1> 👋


Welcome to my GitHub! On here, you'll find my ongoing journey from a Business Technology Management student to an aspiring tech enthusiast. This is where I document my learning, build interesting projects, and work towards becoming an adept programmer.

🎓 I'm currently in my third year, studying Bachelor of Commerce with a specialization in Business Technology Management. This unique blend of business and technology education is equipping me with an interesting perspective on how tech can solve real world business problems.

💻 My passion for programming is coupled with a dream to work in a high-end tech firm, hopefully in a programming or project management role. I believe that the synergy between my business knowledge and my technical skills can bring a unique perspective to the field.

🏀 When I am not studying or coding, you can probably find me watching or playing sports. I'm a die-hard fan of Chelsea and the Toronto Raptors.

🎨 I'm also into art, music, film, and tech in general. They not only stimulate my creativity, but also inspire me to explore new perspectives which I often find helpful in problem-solving and ideation.

🔭 I am currently working on various projects that range from web development to data analysis, each one helping me understand different programming concepts better. I am also open to collaborating on projects or learning about potential opportunities.

📫 Feel free to get in touch with me about anything, whether it's about my projects, your shared interest in sports, or just to chat about life in general.

🌱 I'm currently learning more about artificial intelligence and machine learning, and exploring how they can be integrated into business solutions.

👨‍💻 Some of my favorite tech tools are Python, Java, SQL, and R.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile! Don't forget to check out my projects and feel free to leave some feedback.

Remember: Keep learning and keep building. Let's code the future together!
